    "text": "These are the steps that you will take today to get started on your project. Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

    "text": "For Blog Post #3 we have started to clean up the data. We read the original file ‘Mental_Health_Care_in_the_Last_4_Weeks.csv’, which you can see in the dataset folder. We then started to clean the data up and we have put the code in the R file in the dataset folder as well. In order to clean the data up, we essentially got rid of the last 3 columns, and we got rid of any non-value cells. The columns we got rid of were ‘Confidence Interval’, ‘Quartile Range’ and ‘Suppression Flag’. We got rid of ‘Confidence Interval’ because you can calculate that using the previous two columns: LowCI and HighCI. We got rid of ‘Quartile Range’ because there were empty cells, i.e., not available for all of our data points. And the ‘Suppression Flag’ column was entirely empty. We then converted the file into a RDS file called, cleaned_dataset, which should be in the dataset folder. There is a R markdown file with our cleaned up data titled ‘load_and_clean.R’\nAfter looking at the data again, we realized that the ‘Suppression Flag’ column indicated any missing data points. So we will be going back and deleting empty participants. We will be able to do this by simply looking at participants or data points that have more than one missing column. We can use the complete function to do this. We shall have it done soon."

    "text": "For this blog post, we found a second and third data set, which we have added to the Data Set folder. We will be looking at employment across the states in USA during the period that the mental health data was collected (2020). We hope to find some sort of correlation between lower employment rates and greater mental health problems, across states. We also think as employment rates improve, mental health scores would improve too. So, for the final project we may consider looking at employment data from post-covid, i.e., 2021 or 2022. If we are able to combine more than one dataset into one dataset.\nWe will also look at the GDP (gross domestic product), as an indicator for income. We will then do multiple regressions (or ANOVAs) to see how these variables (mental health, employment, income), interact with each other. We have also added the GDP data to the Data Set folder. Again, for the final project, we will try to do the same for GDP where we look at the variable across time, and therefore pull 2021 and/or 2022 data.\nWe may also try to combine the unemployment and GDP datasets into one, so it is one dataset, as they are both split by State."

By analyzing these variables, we hope to be able to understand variables that impacted people’s mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Below, we have graphed each demographic variable with the average percent of people who required mental health intervention (as indicated by the variable “Took Prescription Medication for Mental Health And/Or Received Counseling or Therapy, Last 4 Weeks”).\nThe x-value “Time Period” is a measure of 2-week phases, therefore 20 is 40 weeks from when they first started collecting data. The time period spans across an overall 90 week period. Thus, the first data obtain is on Aug 31, 2020, time period 30 is May 24, 2021, and the time data is on May 9, 2022. We can see for all indicator, the average value of the mental problem is increase along the time.\n\ndetailed data summary\nFor all the following analyze, we are focus on the indicator “Took Prescription Medication for Mental Health And/Or Received Counseling or Therapy, Last 4 Weeks”\n\ngeneral summary\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding missing grouping variables: `Subgroup`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nMin\nMax\nMean\n\n\n\n\nHispanic or Latino along time\n17.20000\n23.20000\n19.58182\n\n\nNon-Hispanic Asian, single race along time\n10.30000\n15.90000\n12.66970\n\n\nNon-Hispanic Black, single race along time\n15.60000\n21.50000\n19.34545\n\n\nNon-Hispanic White, single race along time\n25.10000\n30.20000\n27.75152\n\n\nNon-Hispanic, other races and multiple races along time\n23.70000\n32.90000\n28.60909\n\n\nFemale along time\n27.50000\n33.80000\n30.69091\n\n\nMale along time\n16.30000\n20.20000\n18.49394\n\n\nBachelor’s degree or higher along time\n23.80000\n28.40000\n26.06970\n\n\nHigh school diploma or GED along time\n19.40000\n25.10000\n21.92727\n\n\nLess than a high school diploma along time\n15.80000\n25.40000\n21.20606\n\n\nSome college/Associate’s degree along time\n23.50000\n30.00000\n27.15455\n\n\nage\n16.46667\n27.18182\n23.65541\n\n\nstate\n16.93030\n30.74242\n25.95799\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a difference in the average mental health scores between the races. From this graph, one case see that the race with the lowest mental health scores (engagement with mental health interventions), is Asian. It is then followed by Black, then Hispanic or Latino. And the races with the highest mental health scores are White and other race or multiple races. If you look at these values across time the order of these races in terms of mental health scores stay the same, but there are large variations among the Asian participants and the other races or multiple races. These two groups, as well as White participants, seem to have an increase in their mental health scores across time.\n\n\nsex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a difference in the average mental health values between males and females. Across, time this difference remains equally prominent with females overall having higher mental health scores than males. This suggests that more females than males used mental health services. However, much like the other variables, there was a slight increase across time\n\n\neducation level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appears that there is some variation in use of mental health interventions across education levels. It appears people with greater education levels seem to have poorer mental health, however this could be correlated with age or other more significant factors. Interestingly, there seems to be great variation in the correlation between education levels and mental health across the 90-week period, as indicated by the second graph. But, in general, the percentage of people who require mental health intervention increases over time.\n\n\nage\n\n\n\n\n\nAs one can see, there is a clear negative correlation between the percentage of people who required mental health intervention and age group, indicating as age increased the need for mental health resources (and the impact of mental health) decreased. One could say perhaps the younger population was more impacted by the social isolation that the COVID-19 posed.\n\n\nunemployment rate:\nby time across the USA:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unemployment rate by time vs the value shows a clear trend that when the unemployment rate is high, the mental health of whole country seems to be better.\nBy state, average of all time:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unemployment rate by state vs the value also shows a trend that the lower unemployment rate in fact increase the mental health problem. The bar chart is divided by the median of the unemployment rate (5.5%), it also shows that the higher unemployment rate usually indicate a better mental health"
