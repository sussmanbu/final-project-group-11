## Investigating Mental Health as a Virtue of the Pandemic and Other Demographic Factors 

### Introduction
The pandemic placed many burdens on our society. People were socially isolated, and financially burdened, due to unemployment as well as reduced overall income. We also know that these disproportionately affected people due to their demographic factors, i.e., the state that they live in or the race that they are. All of these factors collectively therefore had an impact on people’s mental health. This study therefore set out to investigate the impact of the pandemic on the 

## Thesis: 
We believe that as unemployment increases, and income decreases, due to the pandemic, mental health scores for anxiety and depression will increase, and so will seeking mental health resources. This is why we compare the data from 2020 to 2022 to see if these got better in a post-lockdown world. 

## Data and Methodology
We have brought together data from the CDC, regarding mental health, and data on unemployment, education levels and GDP from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. By analyzing these variables, we hope to be able to understand variables that impacted people’s mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Below, we have graphed each demographic variable with the average percent of people who required mental health intervention (as indicated by the variable “Took Prescription Medication for Mental Health And/Or Received Counseling or Therapy, Last 4 Weeks”). 


The x-value “Time Period” is a measure of 2-week phases, therefore 20 is 40 weeks from when they first started collecting data. The time period spans across an overall 90 week period. Thus, the first data obtain is on Aug 31, 2020, time period 30 is May 24, 2021, and the time data is on May 9, 2022. We can see for all indicator, the average value of the mental problem is increase along the time.

```


#### race
```{r,echo=FALSE}
p_race_avg
p_race_t
```
There is a difference in the average mental health scores between the races. From this graph, one case see that the race with the lowest mental health scores (engagement with mental health interventions), is Asian. It is then followed by Black, then Hispanic or Latino. And the races with the highest mental health scores are White and other race or multiple races. If you look at these values across time the order of these races in terms of mental health scores stay the same, but there are large variations among the Asian participants and the other races or multiple races. These two groups, as well as White participants, seem to have an increase in their mental health scores across time.

#### sex
```{r,echo=FALSE}
p_sex_avg
p_sex_t
```
There is a difference in the average mental health values between males and females. Across, time this difference remains equally prominent with females overall having higher mental health scores than males. This suggests that more females than males used mental health services. However, much like the other variables, there was a slight increase across time 

#### education level
```{r,echo=FALSE}
p_edu_avg
p_edu_t
```
It appears that there is some variation in use of mental health interventions across education levels. It appears people with greater education levels seem to have poorer mental health, however this could be correlated with age or other more significant factors. Interestingly, there seems to be great variation in the correlation between education levels and mental health across the 90-week period, as indicated by the second graph. But, in general, the percentage of people who require mental health intervention increases over time. 

#### age
```{r,echo=FALSE}
p_age_avg
```
As one can see, there is a clear negative correlation between the percentage of people who required mental health intervention and age group, indicating as age increased the need for mental health resources (and the impact of mental health) decreased. One could say perhaps the younger population was more impacted by the social isolation that the COVID-19 posed.

#### unemployment rate:

by time across the USA:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

filtered_data <- data %>%
  filter(Group == "National Estimate", 
         Indicator == "Took Prescription Medication for Mental Health And/Or Received Counseling or Therapy, Last 4 Weeks")

unrate_data <- read_csv("~/final-project-group-11/dataset/UNRATE.csv",col_types = cols(
  DATE = col_date(format = ""),
  UNRATE = col_double()
))

filtered_data <- filtered_data %>%
  mutate(
    Month = match(substr(`Time Period Label`, 1, 3), month.abb),
    Year = as.integer(substr(`Time Period Label`, nchar(`Time Period Label`)-3, nchar(`Time Period Label`)))
  )

unrate_data <- unrate_data %>%
  mutate(
    Year = year(DATE),
    Month = month(DATE)
  )

un_time_data <- left_join(filtered_data, unrate_data, by = c("Year", "Month"))

un_time_data <- un_time_data %>%
  select(Indicator, Group, `Time Period`, `Time Period Label`, Year, Month, Value, UNRATE)

ggplot(un_time_data, aes(x = UNRATE, y = Value)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Average Value by unemployment rate, observation per half month time",
       x = "Unemployment rate",
       y = "Value")


```
The unemployment rate by time vs the value shows a clear trend that when the unemployment rate is high, the mental health of whole country seems to be better.

By state, average of all time:
```{r,echo=FALSE}
data <- readRDS("dataset/cleaned_dataset.rds")
unemployment_data <- readRDS("dataset/clean_unemployment.rds")

# Filter the main dataset for the specific indicator and for state-level data
filtered_data <- data %>%
  filter(Group == "By State", 
         Indicator == "Took Prescription Medication for Mental Health And/Or Received Counseling or Therapy, Last 4 Weeks") %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarize(Average_Value = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE))

# Prepare the unemployment data
# Assuming the unemployment data contains columns 'State' and 'Average'
unemployment_data_state <- unemployment_data %>%
  rename(State = state) %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarize(Average_Unemployment = mean(Average, na.rm = TRUE))

# Merge the datasets
combined_data <- left_join(filtered_data, unemployment_data_state, by = "State")

# Generate the plot
ggplot(combined_data, aes(x = Average_Unemployment, y = Average_Value, label = State)) +
  geom_point() +
  #geom_text(check_overlap = TRUE, hjust = 1.5, vjust = 1.5) +
  labs(title = "State-wise Comparison of Mental Health Indicator and Unemployment Rate",
       x = "Average Unemployment Rate (%)",
       y = "Average Value of Mental Health Indicator") +
  theme_minimal()
# Continue from the previous combined dataset
# Assuming combined_data contains the necessary merged data

# Classify states based on unemployment rate
median_unemployment_rate <- median(combined_data$Average_Unemployment, na.rm = TRUE)

# Classify states based on the median unemployment rate
combined_data <- combined_data %>%
  mutate(Unemployment_Rate_Category = ifelse(Average_Unemployment < median_unemployment_rate, "< 5.13", ">= 5.13"))


# Calculate mean values for each category
category_means <- combined_data %>%
  group_by(Unemployment_Rate_Category) %>%
  summarize(Mean_Indicator_Value = mean(Average_Value, na.rm = TRUE))

# Generate the bar plot
ggplot(category_means, aes(x = Unemployment_Rate_Category, y = Mean_Indicator_Value, fill = Unemployment_Rate_Category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Mean Mental Health Indicator Value by Unemployment Rate Category",
       x = "Unemployment Rate Category",
       y = "Mean Indicator Value") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel1") # Optional: for better color distinction
```
The unemployment rate by state vs the value also shows a trend that the lower unemployment rate in fact increase the mental health problem. The bar chart is divided by the median of the unemployment rate (5.5%), it also shows that the higher unemployment rate usually indicate a better mental health
