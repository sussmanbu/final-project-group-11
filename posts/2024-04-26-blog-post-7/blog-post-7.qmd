we run the model for indicator and we found the indicator of the treatment or therapy patient recive is statically significant when analyze the mental health score of a person, However, since our data is classification data, it devive into many binary vaiable when doing the analyze, make the model a little complex, in the final model, we plan to add more continuously number data, which is more reliabale and convience in regresion model.

```{r}
main_data <- readRDS("~/final-project-group-11/dataset/cleaned_dataset.rds")
Y <- main_data$Value
X <- main_data$Indicator
model <- lm(Y~X, data=main_data)
summary(model)
```
