    "text": "These are the steps that you will take today to get started on your project. Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

    "text": "For Blog Post #3 we have started to clean up the data. We read the original file ‘Mental_Health_Care_in_the_Last_4_Weeks.csv’, which you can see in the dataset folder. We then started to clean the data up and we have put the code in the R file in the dataset folder as well. In order to clean the data up, we essentially got rid of the last 3 columns, and we got rid of any non-value cells. The columns we got rid of were ‘Confidence Interval’, ‘Quartile Range’ and ‘Suppression Flag’. We got rid of ‘Confidence Interval’ because you can calculate that using the previous two columns: LowCI and HighCI. We got rid of ‘Quartile Range’ because there were empty cells, i.e., not available for all of our data points. And the ‘Suppression Flag’ column was entirely empty. We then converted the file into a RDS file called, cleaned_dataset, which should be in the dataset folder. There is a R markdown file with our cleaned up data titled ‘load_and_clean.R’\nAfter looking at the data again, we realized that the ‘Suppression Flag’ column indicated any missing data points. So we will be going back and deleting empty participants. We will be able to do this by simply looking at participants or data points that have more than one missing column. We can use the complete function to do this. We shall have it done soon."

    "text": "For this blog post, we found a second and third data set, which we have added to the Data Set folder. We will be looking at employment across the states in USA during the period that the mental health data was collected (2020). We hope to find some sort of correlation between lower employment rates and greater mental health problems, across states. We also think as employment rates improve, mental health scores would improve too. So, for the final project we may consider looking at employment data from post-covid, i.e., 2021 or 2022. If we are able to combine more than one dataset into one dataset.\nWe will also look at the GDP (gross domestic product), as an indicator for income. We will then do multiple regressions (or ANOVAs) to see how these variables (mental health, employment, income), interact with each other. We have also added the GDP data to the Data Set folder. Again, for the final project, we will try to do the same for GDP where we look at the variable across time, and therefore pull 2021 and/or 2022 data.\nWe may also try to combine the unemployment and GDP datasets into one, so it is one dataset, as they are both split by State."

A bad example would be if you have no interest in video games but your data set is about video games. I also recommend finding data that is related to current events, social justice, and other areas that have an impact.\nInitially, you will study one dataset but later you will need to combine that data with another dataset. For this reason, I recommend finding data that has some date and/or location components. These types of data are conducive to interesting visualizations and analysis and you can also combine this data with other data that also has a date or location variable. Data from the census, weather data, economic data, are all relatively easy to combine with other data with time/location components."

This file might create a derivative data set that you then use for your subsequent analysis. Note that you don’t need to run this script from every post/page. Instead, you can load in the results of this script, which could be plain text files or .RData files. In your data page you’ll describe how these results were created. If you have a very large data set, you might save smaller data sets that you can use for exploration purposes.
